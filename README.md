# Virtual Escape Room: Maintenance documentation

This is the project I made for my Final Work at the Erasmushogeschool Brussels. It served as a graduating project and was defended in front of a jury.

This virtual escape room was created from a problematic I encountered as an employee at an escape room: how can we bring this experience to people who are not able to experience it in person, due to physical, financial and/or social problems?

The result of this research was the experience you can find in this repository. The goal was to create an experience that was as immersive as possible, while keeping it accessible for everyone. Enjoy!
